Blacksmith is our attempt to create a CLI helper so anyone can easily create their own PHP cli scripts. It is based on the laravel artisan CLI script but totally independent from the framework.

## Features

- Automatic CLI help menu.

- Commands namespacing.

- Easy to use.

- Available through composer.


See the [getting started guide]({{< relref "getting-started/index.md" >}}) for instructions how to get
it up and running.

## Acknowledgements

Anyone helping with the project is awesome but I want to give special thanks to [Graham Sutton](https://github.com/grahamsutt12).
